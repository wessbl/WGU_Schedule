1/30:

2/10:
- Project successfully navigates from Login to SingleAppointment view.
2/20:
- Have figured out popup windows, starting with TimeSelect. 

PROBLEMS:
	- Exception when trying to display a window:
		- Edit the FXML file, make sure the fx:controller tag is filled out correctly. Should start with "Controllers..."
		- Make sure FXMLLoader is given the right window. It should be "/Views/Something.fxml".
		- Last Error Message: NoSuchMethodExc: Controllers.///.<init>(). Make sure there is an empty constructor in the controller class.
